# UnderCover
Undercovermode to switch the desktop to windows 10 from xfce like in Kali Linux. I thought why should it run only on Kali Linux? Let it run everywhere!

## Installation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/strider-paff-shell/UnderCover.git
cd UnderCover
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```
## Uninstall
```sh
cd path/to/UnderCover
chmod +x uninstall.sh
sudo ./uninstall.sh
```

## Addional Notes:
This is not bugfree, you may can have some errors with you xfce4-profile.
To fix that just logout after changing back to your xfce4 theme.
